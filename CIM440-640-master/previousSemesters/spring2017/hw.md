### What is a Code Plan?

Is documenting your code. The code plan is meant to be more of a step by step approach. The three areas that you should focus on:

* Inputs and Outputs
* Interface
* Pseudocode

##### Input and Output

Say what type of input you are going to use and what is it going to do. Then say how it is going to affect your output.

##### Pseudocode

Pseudocode is that writing your code in plain english. Documenting the program flow step by step.

##### Interface

If your project has an interface, draw some thumbnails or design something in illustrator or photoshop.

#### Example - The Hipnotizer

For my project I am going to make a ball move left and right. The program is going to start by clicking a button on the screen.

##### Input

* Button
 * Click button to start
 * Click button to stop

##### Output

* Ellipse
 * Moves left
  * Moves right
  
##### Psuedocode

* Button
 * Click to start, click to stop
  * Need Variable to keep track if started or stopped
 * Click once
  * Var = true
 * Click again
  * Var = false

* Ellipse drawn at the center of screen
* User clicks on button
* Ellipse moves right
 * Ellipse needs a counter ++
 * Check when ellipse reaches the right side of the screen
* When Ellipse reaches the right hand side
 * counter becomes --
* Ellipse moves left
* When ellipse reaches left side of screen counter ++
