# INTRO TO P5JS

## [Reference](http://p5js.org/reference/)

#### WHAT IS CANVAS?

The canvas tag is a new html5 tag that lets you draw and animate graphics in a web browser. It allows programmers using javascript to create graphics programatically.

#### WHAT IS P5JS?

p5js is a javascript library based off Java/Processing. It was developed by Lauren McCarthy. Java/Processing was developed to easily teach and program graphics. p5js was made possible because of the introduction of the html5 Canvas tag and the popularity of Processing.


#### Getting started

[Download Library](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/releases/download/0.5.14/p5.zip)

Download the library, unzip and open the p5 folder. Then open the p5 folder, then expand empty-example, and open sketch.js. Setup  your program code goes in this file.

For every project download or copy a new project.

## STRUCTURE

###### setup

```
function setup() {
  
}
```
The setup function runs once at the beginning of your program.



###### draw

The draw function is an infinite loop that runs when a user visits your page. Code that is placed in the draw will run sequentially.

```
function draw() {
  
}
```


##### Using variables and scope

Variables can be declared throughout your program.

Declaring a variable means saying:

```var num = 100; ```

When declaring a variable location of where the variable is declared is important. If a variable is declared with in a function, that variables scope is only available in that function. Meaning you can only use that variable in that function. For example, this code wont work:

```
function setup() {
  var test = 100;

  console.log(num);
}

function draw() {
    var num = 200;

    console.log(test);

}
```
This code will not work for 2 reasons:

The variable num is only available inside the draw function, so setup has no idea when you want to print num what variable num you are talking about.
The variable test is only available inside the setup function, so the draw has no idea when you want to print test, what variable you are referring to.
When we want to declare variables that are available through out the program we declare them at the top of our program code. This is making the variable globally available to all functions. For example:

```
var num = 200;

function setup() {

  console.log(num);
  
}

function draw() {

    console.log(num);

}
```

In this example, num will be printed once in the setup and infinitely in the draw loop.

###### Printing/Debugging

To find out what your variables are doing throughout your code use:

console.log(VARIABLE);

##### COMMENTS

A comment is a method of documenting your code. This is always useful not only for you, but for others who want to learn your thought process. Comments can also be useful as a debugging tool to take out or test snippets of code without having to make making big changes.

```
//This is a single line comment

/*
This 
is
a
multi-line
Comment
*/
```

Remember that if you run console.log in the draw loop, it will keep printing your variable infinitely.

##### Functions

###### createCanvas(w,h,[renderer])

createCanvas function allows to set a size for your canvas element. It takes in 2 or 3 parameters. You can enter just a width and hieght or width, height, and render.

p5js uses 2 rendering types: P2D vs WEBGL. P2D is generally used for 2d animation. WEBGL is used for 3D animation.



###### background

Function allows you to add a color to your canvas. The background can be set in the setup and the draw. In the setup, the background color will set once. If placed in the draw loop, the background will reset your canvas every draw cycle.

```
// Grayscale integer value
background(51);

// R, G & B integer values
background(255, 204, 0);

// H, S & B integer values
colorMode(HSB);
background(255, 204, 100);

// Named SVG/CSS color string
background('red');

// six-digit hexadecimal RGB notation
background('#222222');

// integer RGB notation
background('rgb(0,255,0)');

// integer RGBA notation
background('rgba(0,255,0, 0.25)');

// percentage RGB notation
background('rgb(100%,0%,10%)');

// percentage RGBA notation
background('rgba(100%,0%,100%,0.5)');

// p5 Color object
background(color(0, 0, 255));
```

##### 2D Primitives

```
arc()

ellipse()

line()

point()

quad()

rect()

triangle()
```
###### Fill

fill(255,125,50);

Fill function, similar to background fills shapes with color. Once fill is called it affects shapes below it.

###### Stroke

stroke(255,125,50);


Sets the stroke color for shape. Similar to Fill when used it affects all of the following shape strokes.

###### strokeWeight

strokeWeight(1);

Sets the thickness of the stroke

###### Color

You can set color as a variable.

var c = color(255, 204, 0);


###### mouseX and mouseY

mouseX and mouseY are built in variables to p5js that allow you to know the current position of the mouse.

```
line(mouseX, 0, mouseX, 100);
line(0, mouseY, 100, mouseY);
```

###### width and height

width and height are built in variables that give you access to your canvas width and height

###### random

Choose random number from max and min, or from an array of numbers.

var r = random(50);


###### map

Lets you constrain the limits of a variable

```map(value,start1,stop1,start2,stop2)


function setup() {
  noStroke();
}

function draw() {
  background(204);
  var x1 = map(mouseX, 0, width, 25, 75);
  ellipse(x1, 25, 25, 25);
  var x2 = map(mouseX, 0, width, 0, 100);
  ellipse(x2, 75, 25, 25);
}
```
