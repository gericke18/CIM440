# What is a Code Plan?

A code plan is documentation of your thought process. You should include a brief section on what your program is. Then write your code in plain english. Make of list of inputs and outputs, as well as variables you might need.

## Example: Finding the center of a tootsie pop

This program is a calculator where the user enters a current count of the licks they have given thier tootsie pop and the calculator returns a percentage of how far they have gone.

* inputs
 * Capture lick amount
* output
 * message telling user result
 
 First, I need the user to tell me the amount of licks. I'll use a form text input for this. The user would have to click on a button to submit their answer. I'll need a button. When the user clicks the button, I'll activate my calculation function. In my function, I need to get the value of the form input. I'll grab the number divide it by 252 the average licks to eat a tootsie pop and multiply by 100. This will give me a percentage. Then I'll return a message telling them how far they have gone.
